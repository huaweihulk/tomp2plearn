     * @param isTCP
     *            A value of true indicates that this is a TCP mapping. A value
     *            of false indicates that this is a UDP mapping.
     * @param internalPort
     *            The port on which this client is listening. A value of zero,
     *            along with a lifetime of zero indicates that all port mappings
     *            for this client are to be removed.
     * @param requestedExternalPort
     *            The external port to request. This port may not be available.
     *            Always check the result of the Message to determine which
     *            external port is assigned. A value of zero indicates that the
     *            NAT-PMP Gateway should choose a port on its own.
     * @param requestedPortMappingLifetime
     *            The time, in seconds, to request the mapping for. A value of
     *            zero requests that this mapping is removed. Always check the
     *            result of the Message to determine the actual lifetime that
     *            was assigned, as it may be different than the requested. The
     *            recommended port mapping lifetime is 3600 seconds. The
     *            protocol specifies an unsigned integer for this parameter,
     *            however Java will not support that as a data type. Therefore,
     *            the parameter is given as a long. Do not assign values larger
     *            than an unsigned int can handle to this parameter.
     * @param listener
     *            The {@link MessageResponseInterface} that will respond to the
     *            message result.
