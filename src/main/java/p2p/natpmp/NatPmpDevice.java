 * This class manages a NAT-PMP device. This class is thread-safe. This manages

 * messages that can be sent to the device.
 * {@link ExternalAddressRequestMessage} can be sent to get the external IP of
 * the gateway. {@link MapRequestMessage} can be sent to map a port for a
 * certain amount of time. These two messages can be put into the message queue
 * through the {@link #enqueueMessage(Message)} method. As this class manages a
 * message queue to the NAT-PMP device, it is important to shut it down
 * correctly. Any mapped ports that are no longer desired should be unmapped
 * before shutdown occurs. Refer to {@link #NatPmpDevice(boolean)} for details
 * about the shutdown mechanism.
