/**
 * A sample class class used by the routing mechanism to prioritise peers with
 * a low latency during routing.
 *
 * First sorting criteria is bit distance measured in equal high-bits. Closer peers
 * are prioritised.
 *
 * Second sorting criteria is the availability of RTT information. Peers with RTT
 * measurements are prioritised.
 *
 * Third sorting criteria is the average RTT. Faster responding peers are prioritised.
 *
 * The last tie-breaker is the complete XOR distance.
 *
 * It is important to never let the comparator return 0 for non-equal peer addresses,
 * as this would conflict with the usage of the comparator in the TreeSet, where
 * the comparator returning 0 means that both entries are equal.
